2D Ising Model Simulation (Metropolis Algorithm)
This project implements a Monte Carlo simulation of the 2D Ising model using the Metropolis algorithm. It demonstrates how collective behaviour (e.g. magnetisation) emerges from simple local interactions.

The model is run across a range of temperatures to observe the ferromagneticâ€“paramagnetic phase transition. Visual outputs include:

Spin lattice snapshots

Magnetisation vs temperature curve

This simulation is relevant for understanding energy landscapes, local minima, and how systems like this inspire quantum annealing techniques.
